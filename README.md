📦 Distributed Key-Value Store
🖥 A distributed key-value store with sharding and automatic request forwarding.

🚀 Features:
✅ Sharding – requests are automatically routed to the correct node.
✅ HTTP API – simple REST interface for interacting with the database.
✅ Logging – transparent request tracking and forwarding.
✅ Horizontal scaling – easily add new nodes.

📌 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distributed-kv-store.git
cd distributed-kv-store
2. Install dependencies
cargo build --release
3. Start three nodes (shards)
cargo run -- --port 8080
cargo run -- --port 8081
cargo run -- --port 8082
⚡ API Usage
Set a key
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "user123", "value": "Hello"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/set
Get a key
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/get?key=user123"
Delete a key
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/del?key=user123"
🔄 If the key is stored on a different shard, the request is automatically forwarded to the correct server.

🔧 How It Works
-The /set request determines the correct shard for the given key and either stores it locally or forwards the request.
-The /get request first checks the local node – if the key isn’t found, it forwards the request to the correct shard.
-The /del request works the same way – first checking locally, then forwarding if necessary.
-Logs help track where requests are going and which node is responsible for each key.
